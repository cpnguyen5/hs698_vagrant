        <p class="text-left">
          The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) distributes this public dataset in order to assure transparency,
          affordability, and accountability of the American healthcare system. The datasets provides information on services
          and procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries by physicians and other healthcare professionals. This encompasses
          information on utilization, payment (allowed amount and Medicare payment), as well as submitted charges categorized
          by National Provider Identifier (NPI), Healthcare Common Procedure Coding Systems (HCPCS) code, and place of service.
          The Provider Utilization and Payment data is based on information from administrative claims data for Medicare
          beneficiaries enrolled in the fee-for-service program.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of summary tables or datasets within:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Physician and other Supplier (PUF) Detailed Data File - <strong>"PUF"</strong></li>
            <li>Medicare State/National HCPCS Aggregate Tables - <strong>"Report"</strong></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Limitations: </strong></p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Data may not be representative of a physician's entire practice (only includes information on Medicare
              fee-for-service beneficiaries).</li>
            <li>Data only includes information for Medicare beneficiaries with Part B FFS coverage and not other Medicare
              programs.</li>
            <li>Data is not intended to indicate the quality of care and are not risk-adjusted to account for differences
              in underlying severity of disease of patient populations.</li>
            <li>The data does not include data for services that were performed on <10 beneficiaries. Thus, may be
                underestimating the true Part B FFS totals.</li>
            <li>Some providers may bill under both an individual and organizational NPI. It is difficult to determine a
              provider's actual total.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>"Report"</strong>
            <small>Medicare Physician and Other Supplier National Provider Identifier (NPI) Aggregate Report</small>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The dataset contains information on utilization, payment, and submitted charges organized by NPI. HCPCS drug
            indicator is also included to identify whether the HCPCS product or service is a drug per definition of the
            Medicare Part B Drug ASP list. Sub-totals for medical type and drug services as well as beneficiary
            demographic and health characteristics are provided within the dataset (e.g. race, sex, chronic conditions).
        </p>

        <h3><strong>"PUF"</strong>
            <small>Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Physician and Other Supplier (PUF)</small>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The spending and utilization data in the PUF dataset are aggregated by NPI, HCPCS code, and place of service
            (facility or non-facility). There may be multiple records for a given NPI based on the number of distinct HCPCS
            codes that were billed and where services were provided.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>"Cancer"</strong>
            <small>Big Cities Health Coalition Inventory Data: Cancer Incidence</small>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The "Cancer" dataset is a filtered view derived from the Big Cities Health Inventory Data, which reports
            epidemiologic data on the leading causes of morbidity and mortality for large cities. The filtered view
            specifically focuses on one health indicator, in this case cancer, and its impact in the community.
